Quran Quiz is an open-source Arabic multiple choice questionnaire to test how good you study Quran. It's considered a game as well :).

Quran Quiz is an offline game, it creates an on-phone profile. This profile is needed to parameterize the questionnaire. When the user exits the game, the final score is sent anonymously to our [server](http://quranquiz.net).

The game is intended to support on-line multi-player as well. The project is still under active early-stage development.
